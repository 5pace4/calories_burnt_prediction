# calories_burnt_prediction with XGBoost
## Introduction
In our modern era, health and fitness have become paramount concerns for individuals seeking a balanced and wholesome lifestyle. The intersection of technology and wellness has given rise to sophisticated tools, among which predictive modeling stands out as a powerful means to enhance our understanding of how our bodies respond to physical activity. The Calorie Prediction with XGBoost project delves into the realm of machine learning, specifically leveraging the XGBoost algorithm, to unravel the intricate relationship between exercise patterns and calorie expenditure.

As we embark on this journey, it's crucial to recognize the significance of predicting calorie consumption accurately. Such predictions can be instrumental for individuals striving to achieve fitness goals, optimize their workout routines, or even for professionals in the fields of nutrition and fitness coaching. By harnessing the capabilities of XGBoost, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm renowned for its prowess in handling complex datasets, this project aims to provide a practical and insightful tool for estimating calorie expenditure based on various exercise-related features.

## Description
The heart of this project lies in its application of regression modeling to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity. The 'exercise.csv' dataset forms the foundation, containing a myriad of features that encapsulate diverse aspects of exercise routines, such as duration, intensity, and type of activity. Complementing this, the 'calories.csv' dataset holds the crucial target variable, 'Calories,' representing the actual calorie expenditure during these exercises.

The choice of XGBoost is strategic. XGBoost, an optimized distributed gradient boosting library, has proven to be exceptionally adept at handling intricate relationships within data. Its ability to capture non-linear dependencies and mitigate overfitting makes it an ideal candidate for a regression task of this nature. Through this project, we not only aim to build an accurate predictive model but also to demystify the process, making it accessible for enthusiasts and professionals alike to delve into the fascinating world of machine learning.

Understanding the nuances of calorie prediction is not only beneficial for individual well-being but also holds implications for broader health and fitness research. The insights derived from such predictive models can contribute to the development of personalized fitness plans, optimizing health outcomes, and fostering a data-driven approach to physical well-being.

As we navigate through the various stages of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and accuracy evaluation, this project serves as a comprehensive guide. It stands not only as a testament to the power of machine learning in the health and fitness domain but also as an open invitation for exploration, learning, and customization to meet diverse requirements.

Join us on this exciting journey where data science meets wellness, and together, let's unlock the potential of predictive modeling in the pursuit of a healthier and more informed lifestyle.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of machine learning for health and fitness.

## Dataset Overview
- Two datasets are used: 'exercise.csv' and 'calories.csv'.
- The 'exercise' dataset contains features.
- The 'calories' dataset contains the target variable 'Calories'.
- The datasets are loaded using Pandas.

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are checked and confirmed to be absent in both datasets.
  
  ```python
  print(exercise.isnull().values.any())
  print(calories.isnull().values.any())
- The 'exercise' and 'calories' datasets are combined based on the 'Calories' column.
  
  ```python
  calories = pd.concat([exercise, calories['Calories']], axis = 1)
## Categoriacal Encoding
- Categorical data (e.g., 'Gender') is encoded numerically.
  
  ```python
  calories.replace({"Gender": {'male': 0, 'female': 1}}, inplace=True)
## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Basic statistics are calculated for the combined dataset.
- Data visualizations include count plots, distribution plots, and a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.
  
  ```python
  correlation = calories.corr()
  plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
  sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='Blues', square=True, fmt=".1f", linewidths=0.5)
## Model Training
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
  
   ```python
   X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.1, random_state = 0)
- An XGBoost regressor is trained on the training set.
  
  ```python
  regressor = XGBRegressor()
  regressor.fit(X_train, Y_train)
  
## Evaluation Metrics
Predictions are made on the test set, and accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ²) are calculated.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, this machine learning regression project offers practical insights into using XGBoost for predicting numerical outcomes. The provided code and documentation serve as a starting point for further exploration and customization.
